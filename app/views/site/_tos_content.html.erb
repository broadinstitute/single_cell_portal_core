<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>You must sign up to SCP under a Google-managed identity. Both private Gmail accounts and institutional Google Apps
  accounts are allowed. For increased security when using SCP, we recommend enabling 2-Step verification for your Google-managed
  identity.</p>
<h3>User Uploaded Content</h3>
<p>Studies submitted on the SCP can be designated by the submitter as “public” or “private”. Public studies generally
  allow anyone visiting SCP to view the study and related data, and anyone logged into SCP can download related data
  (though even for public studies, data can be embargoed restricting data download to only those who have explicit authorization
  to download in). Private studies restrict viewing and data download access to the creator of the study, and those users
  who have the study specifically shared with them.  In addition, for operational and administrative purposes, SCP admins
  reserve the right to have a minimal number of application and administrative accounts that have the potential to view
  oth public and private  portal studies; but we do not access private portal studies except to maintain the site or otherwise
  with the permission of the listed study owner.</p>
<p>All data submitted to SCP under a public study, including any names and contact info provided with the data, will be
  made available for unrestricted public view, redistribution and reuse. Thus, it is your responsibility as a data contributor
  to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gain permission from any data sources and collaborators in order to share this information with SCP.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the data you are providing is accurate and complete.</li>
  <li>Ensure your data contributions comply with the ethical, legal, and regulatory norms and standards of the country it
    was generated in, as well as applicable international norms and standards. In particular, you must not include personal
    or confidential data unless appropriate consents and/or approvals have been obtained.</li>
  <li>Assure the owner and individuals who have sharing access to a study agree to having their emails associated publicly
    with the study or have sharing access removed before the study is public.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data Retention Policy</h3>
<p>All users creating a new study are permitted to upload and host data on SCP free of charge by selecting the "Default"
  Terra billing project.  Any study created in that project will be subject to the following data retention policy.
  Any study created using a user-controlled Terra billing project is not subject to this policy.</p>
<h4>Public Studies</h4>
<p>Any study marked as "public" that provides visualizations and/or downloadable data files can be stored indefinitely
  provided it remains public and accessible.</p>
<h4>Private Studies</h4>
<p>Any study that is not publicly accessible may be stored for a term of up to one year from the data of creation.
  After this term expires, such studies will be candidates for removal.  Study owners will be notified prior to
  any removal and given a period of 30 days in which to convert their study to public.  After this period expires, any
  remaining private studies are subject to removal at the discretion of SCP admins.</p>
<h3>Data Embargoes</h3>
<p>All studies in SCP may enforce a data embargo that will prevent other users from downloading data files before the
  embargo expires.  The embargo will have a maximum length of two (2) years from date of study creation if the study is
  public.</p>
<h3>Access Levels</h3>
<p>Your level of access to SCP is limited to ensure your access is no more than necessary to perform your legitimate tasks
  or assigned duties. If you believe you are being granted access that you should not have, you must immediately notify
  the Broad Institute.</p>
<h3>Termination of Use</h3>
<p>We may in our sole discretion suspend/terminate your access to SCP without notification for violation of the Terms of
  Service, or for other conduct that we deem harmful/unlawful to others. We may also periodically review accounts for which
  a user has not logged on.</p>
<h3>External Links</h3>
<p>SCP may provide links or portals to other products, information or services that are maintained or controlled by external
  organizations. These links are not an endorsement of information, products, or services, and do not imply a direct
  association between the Broad Institute and the operators of the outside resource links. Your activities with respect
  to any third party products, services or portals may be governed by different terms.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>
<p>You expressly understand and agree that your use of SCP, or any material available through it, is at your own risk.
  Neither the Broad Institute nor its employees warrant that SCP will be uninterrupted, problem-free, free of omissions,
  or error-free; nor do they make any warranty as to the results that may be obtained from SCP. The content hosted on
  SCP is experimental / academic in nature, and should only be used for research purposes. It should not be used to make

<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>In no event will the Broad Institute or its employees be liable for the incidental, indirect, special, punitive, exemplary,
  or consequential damages, arising out of your use of or inability to use SCP, including without limitation, loss of
  revenue or anticipated profits, loss of goodwill, loss of data, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
  damages.</p>
<h3>Choice of Law</h3>
<p>These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard
  to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms
  shall be finally settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in English, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules
  and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator
  with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected
  from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such
  arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate
  disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of
  competent jurisdiction. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in
  the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, or the District of Massachusetts.
  Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis: class arbitrations and class actions are not
  permitted. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND BROAD ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO
  TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
